PART 3

Markup wireframes with Appearance CSS

Review the three wireframes that you produced for the large screen version of your web site from part 1 of the team project and add to them to ensure that they have the appearance that you wish your site to have. Ensure that you have agreed the colours that will be applied to the elements. Agree the font family or specific font that you will use for different parts of your site, and the colours that should be used.

Work through the wireframes and decide on the correct CSS to build those pages, and add classes and identities to the pages. Mark up your wireframes accordingly. Upload a .zip file of these new marked-up versions of the wireframes into the Workspace: static web pages in week 10.

Set up and link stylesheet

Code the CSS stylesheet with these appearance styling instructions and link them to the correct HTML elements using the class and id mechanism.

Upload the pages to the static web page system

Upload your three new versions of HTML pages to the Workspace: static web page system in week 10 with the class and id properties and the CSS stylesheet within a tidy directory structure. Test that everything is working as expected by loading the pages in a browser using the shareable URL for your web site.
