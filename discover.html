You then exit the paddock and experience more wildness right over the water. The ride features two launches, a 155-foot top-hat, and four inversions, including the “Mosasaurus Roll” that almost takes you underwater. The Velocicoaster is a great example of combining thrills, theming, and storytelling to great effect. Hold on to your butts.</p>
